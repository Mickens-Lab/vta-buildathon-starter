// The mediator's URL comes from its DID document (a did:webvh fetched from the mediator's own host), so this page cannot proxy it:
// its origin must be allowed (MEDIATOR_CORS_ALLOW_ORIGIN), both for that did.jsonl fetch and for the socket. When either is blocked
// the browser reports a bare "Failed to fetch" (wrapped by the resolver as "did:webvh resolve failed: invalidDid — Failed to fetch"),
// so the verdict adds the exact line to set and, when the mediator DID names its host, the command that recreates only the mediator.
